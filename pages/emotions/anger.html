                     It is typically characterized by feelings of stress, frustration, and irritation. Everyone feels anger from time to time.
                     It's a perfectly normal response to frustrating or difficult situations."

                        <span class="hello">   Anger is a completely normal and typically healthy emotion.But it’s important to find healthy ways to express it so as not to alienate people around us.
                            Expressing anger healthily is also important for your mental health. 
                       </span>
                       However, it can be detrimental to both your emotional and physical health when you lose control of it.
                       When you are angry your body goes through some physiological and biological changes.

                       Your heart rate quickens and your blood pressure spikes. 
                       Your body also releases hormones like adrenaline and noradrenaline. 
                       Putting your body through these changes often, by repeatedly getting angry, can lead to medical conditions and complications such as: 
                       
                       high blood pressure ,
                       depression ,
                       anxiety ,
                       insomnia ,
                       substance abuse ,
                       gastric ulcers ,
                       bowel disease and
                       diabetes .Anger doesn’t look the same in everyone as we all express it differently.

                     <p class="anger_can-p">Anger can be caused by either external or internal influences. A person or an event could make you angry.
                        Sometimes we use anger to replace other emotions we would rather not deal with, like emotional pain, fear, loneliness, or loss.
                         In these cases, anger becomes a secondary emotion.

                       <h4>Identify the Cause:</h4>
                            <p>The first step to coping with anger is identifying the root cause of your anger. </p>
                      <h4>
                        Meditate:
                      </h4>
                  <p>
                    Meditation is very beneficial in helping to control human emotions. You can start with simple meditation techniques like deep breathing exercises.
                     When faced with a situation that makes you angry, take a second before reacting
                  </p>
                  <h4>
                    Work Out:
                  </h4>
                <p>
                    Exercising isn’t just great for your physical health—it’s also beneficial for your mental health.
                     It’s also a way to channel out emotions like anger in a useful and productive way.

                    <p>
                        Bottling up the emotion is most likely to cause a sudden and intense outburst when you least expect it.
