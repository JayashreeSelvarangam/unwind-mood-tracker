                        Sadness can be expressed in a number of ways including:
                        
                        crying,
                        dampened mood,

                        In some cases, people can experience prolonged and severe periods of sadness that can turn into depression. 
                        Sadness can often lead people to engage in coping mechanisms such as avoiding other people, self-medicating, and ruminating on negative thoughts.
                         Such behaviors can actually extends feelings of sadness and prolong the duration of the emotion.
